Setup code to load `tidyverse` and `moderndive` libraries and to open
the `early_january_weather` dataset.

``` r
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE)
library(tidyverse)
library(moderndive)
data("early_january_weather") 
```

# Problem 1

### Determining `early_january_weather` dataset details.

``` r
# Determining size of `early_january_weather` dataset with `nrow` and `ncol`
nrow(early_january_weather)
```

    ## [1] 358

``` r
ncol(early_january_weather)
```

    ## [1] 15

``` r
# Determining mean temperature of `early_january_weather` dataframe using variable `temp`
df = early_january_weather

mean(df$temp)
```

    ## [1] 39.58212

The dataset `early_january_weather` contains weather data from EWR
(`origin`) between 01Sept2013 and 15Sept2013 and includes variables
`origin`, `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, `temp`, `dewp`, `humid`,
`wind_dir`, `wind_speed`, `wind_gust`, `precip`, `pressure`, `visib`,
and `time_hour`.

There are 358 rows and 15 columns according to `nrow` and `ncol`
respectively.

The mean temperature is 39.58212 degrees Fahrenheit.

### Creating a scatterplot of `temp`(y) vs.Â `time_hour`(x)

``` r
# Scatterplot of `temp` vs `time_hour`, colored by `humid`
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + geom_point()
```

![](P8105_HW1_ah4028_files/figure-gfm/scatterplot-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
# Exporting scatterplot `temp` vs `time_hour` 
ggsave("early_january_weather_time_hour_by_temp.pdf", height = 4, width = 10)
```

The scatterplot shows that `time_hour` and `temp` have a positively
correlated relationship such that as `time_hour` increases, `temp`
increases.

## Problem 2

### Creating a data frame with specific variables and dimensions.

``` r
# Set seed to ensure reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Defining Data Frame
problem2_df = tibble(
  vec_numeric = rnorm(10, sd=1),
  vec_logical = vec_numeric > 0,
  vec_char = c("I", "am", "enjoying", "the", "data", "science", "course", "at", "Columbia", "immensely"),
  vec_factor = factor(rep(c("yes", "no", "maybe"), length = 10))
)
```

# Pulling vectors out of the dataframe to obtain their means

``` r
mean_vec_numeric = mean(pull(problem2_df, vec_numeric))
mean_vec_logical = mean(pull(problem2_df, vec_logical))
mean_vec_char = mean(pull(problem2_df, vec_char))
mean_vec_factor = mean(pull(problem2_df, vec_factor))
```

We are unable to pull the mean from `vec_char` and `vec_factor` because
they do not contain numeric variables.

# Converting problem2_df vectors `vec_logical`, `vec_char`, and `vec_factor` to numeric variables

``` r
as.numeric(pull(problem2_df, vec_logical))
as.numeric(pull(problem2_df, vec_char))
as.numeric(pull(problem2_df, vec_factor))
```

Because `vec_logical` is true/false, `as.numeric` translates it to
binary. With `vec_char`, the `as.numeric` is unable to translate the
nominal data points and creates NA values as a result. Finally, with
`vec_factor`, `as.numeric` is able to translate the levels into a 3
level categorical variable.
